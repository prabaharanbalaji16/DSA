Graph:
    Un-directed Graph
    Directed Graph
    Weighted directed graph
    Weighted Undirected graph
    Weighted Cyclic directed graph
    Weighted Cyclic Undirected graph
    Cyclic Directed graph 
    Acyclic Directed graph

Graph has two things: i) Vertex ii) Edges

Vertex is like points or nodes and Edges are like the line or connection 
between two Vertex.

If the vertex are not in ordered pair and edges have no directions then it is Undirected graph or
if it vertex's are ordered and edges have direction then it is Directed graph.

Graph can be represented by :
i) Adjaceny Matrix
ii)  Adjaceny List

Directed Graph (Di graph):

Directed Graph is a set pf vertices connected by directed edges.

Topological Sort:
    The vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices are pushed in the stack.
    First push all the vertices in to the stack and then print them it.
