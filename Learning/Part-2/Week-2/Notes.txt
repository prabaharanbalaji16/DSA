Spanning tree:
    Spanning tree is a subset of a Graph, which is connected, weighted and directed Graph and there is no cycle when it
    traverse from one edge to another.

Minimum spanning tree:
    Graph can have many spanning tree. But Minimum spanning tree or minimum weighted spanning tree which is connected,
    weighted and undirected Graph whose is weight less than or equal to the other spanning tree.
    N nodes and N-1 edges
