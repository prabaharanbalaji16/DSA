Mergesort:

    Find the middle index and using that separate the array into two recursively 
and sort the arrays and merge it again.

QuickSort:

    Select the first element in the array and consider an a paritioning element and move all the elements which are smaller than 
the partitioning element to left and move all the elements which are greater than the partitioning element to the right. 
Now just like mergesort, divide the array into two sub-array recursively and sort it.

Shuffuling the array before partitioning it will give extra performance.

QuickSelect:
    
    Quick selection is used to find the kth element in an un-sorted array. Like Quick Sort, partitioning has
 to be done. So that the elements which are left to the partitioning element are smaller and the elements
 which are right to the partitioning elements are greater. After sorting the array, find the element from the
 array which is present at Kth position.
