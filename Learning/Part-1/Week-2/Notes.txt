Stack:-
    It is a data strcuture.
    It is based on the concept Last in First out. Means the recently added item will be the first one to delete.

Linked List:
    Linked list is a linear data strcuture where the data are not stored in contigous memory. The data in the linked list
are linked to each other by pointers.

Array Resizing:-
    Array size is defined at the time of declaring or initializing. It's not possible to change the array size after that.
But what we can do is define the the size of the array while declaring it. Then while the application is running if the array is reaching it's
total length, then create a new array with double the size of the an existing array and copy the values between.

Like this :

void resize(int capacity)
     {
        String[] copy = new String[capacity];   // copy is the new array and capacity is 2*q.length
        for(int i=0;i<q.length;i++)
        {
            copy[i] = q[i];
        }
        q = copy;       //q is an already existing array
    } 

** Java Linked List library take linear time to find an index in the array, where as Array takes constant time to
find an index.

Application of Stacks:-
    Back button in a Web browser
    Parsing in a Compiler



Sorting:-

Selection sort:
    check the minimum value in the array and them swaps it to the first element in the array, then searchs
the next minimum value and swaps it with the element which is in next position and it goes till the end.
Its quadratic in time.

Insertion Sort :

    Everything on the left of the i'th index should be sorted. Index moves to the every element one by one and checks that the current 
element is less that the element before. if it is less than then swaps the position. Now again current index check less than to the 
element before it. If it is less, then swaps the position. Continue this to the end of the array and swaps till it sorted. The elements move 
only one position even it has a long way to go.


Shell Sort:

    Shell Sort is an extension of Insertion sort without the drawbacks of Insertion sort. Just like Insertion sort, it  compares and swaps the
elements but these compares and swaps are happens between two elements which are far away from each other. and eventually the gap will reduce
on the next iterations and at the end whole array will be sorted.

It's Linear (N) for Best case and Quadratic (N2) for worst and average case
