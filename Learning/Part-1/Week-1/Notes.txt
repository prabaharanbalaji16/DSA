Steps to developing a usable algorithm
    Model the problem
    Find a algorithm to solve it
    Fast Enough ? Fits in Memory
    If not, Figure it out why
    Find a way to address the problem
    Iterate until satisfied

Dynamic Connectivity:
    Operations :-
    i) Union - Define a  path between two points.
    ii) Connnected - Check whether a two points is connected or not.

Types of Connectivity:
    Reflexive : p is connected to q.
    Symmentric : if p is connected to q then q is connected to p.
    Transitive: If p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then r is connected to p.

Connected Components :
    Group of connected to elements is know as Components.
    Eg: {0} {1 4 5 6 8} {2 3 7 9} --- Three connected Components

Application of Dynamic Connectivity:-
    Pixels in a Digital Photo.
    Computers in a network.
    Friend in a Socail Media.


    Algorithm                           TimeTaken

    Quick-Find                              M N
    Quick-Union                             M N
    Weighted QU                           N+M Log N
    QU + path compression                 N+M Log N
    Weighted QU + path compression        N+M lg* N

    lg*  - iterated log function  -   Number of times to take the log N to get 1
